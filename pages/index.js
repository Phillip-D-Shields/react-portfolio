          I threw this together to show off some of my noob skills. I am still
          working on making things mobile responsive, so apologies if you tried
          viewing this on a phone ðŸ˜¬.

          This digital resume was built using react, nextjs, and styled
          components.I have some planned additions when I get some time.
