          Digiwha is a new project I am working on with a friend. Digiwha
          gamifies learning Te Reo MƒÅori. This is a MVP and still under
          development, but the landing page is pretty neat. It is a passion
          project that we are developing in our spare time.

        <p>
          For the third assessment of my WEB601 class at NMIT, I made an NFT
          market for the Ethereum blockchain. In order to interact with the live
          example you need{" "}
          <a href="https://metamask.io/" className="text-link">
            metamask browser wallet
          </a>{" "}
          connected to the Rinkeby test network. And you will need{" "}
          <a href="https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby" className="text-link">
            some rinkeby test net eth
          </a>{" "}
          to create or purchase NFTs. Not to worry, test net eth is free. The
          market is built with react, nextjs, hardhat, and tailwind css
          framework.

          This is a travel guru that shows the most popular places to eat,
